<h2> Logline </h2>

<p> LAN is a digital idol who embodies resilience and hope in the face of the impossible. LAN's immersive experience invites viewers into her world, where they can explore the intersection of humanity and technology while connecting with LAN's message of perseverance and strength. </p>

<h2> Project description </h2>

<p> LAN is a digital musical persona that aims to connect with her audience through an immersive experience that incorporates AR and VR techniques. Her story, which revolves around resilience, hope, and perseverance, is told over songs and videos that involve interaction and multiple platforms and formats.<br><br>

LAN's intended audience is young women and girls between the ages of 14-18+, but her story can resonate with anyone who has ever felt alone or broken. Although there is a lot of overlap with Kpop and Kpop audiences, LAN brings a new freshness to the industry.<br><br>

The goal of this project is to create a character that represents the human experience in a digital age. With the advent of artificial intelligence and the recent debuting of the first generation of digital idols in Asia, many questions have arisen about what it means to be real and what kind of entertainment we consume. LAN's existence begs many questions of the participant; what does it mean to be a human in a digital age? Is it okay for completely digital idols to take the place of human ones? What does loneliness look like, and how can it be lessened or eliminated as more of our relationships and interactions are digitized?<br><br>

LAN's debut will be a completely digital experience that viewers can experience in their own homes. However, LAN's mission to connect with the non-digital world will manifest itself in several gallery spaces across the world. The darkrooms in galleries that feature video and audio projects will become portals to the place LAN calls home.<br><br>

The project's aim is to draw attention to the parts of technology that we fear or find uncanny and bring a thoughtful lens to look at it through. It raises questions about the relationship between humans and technology and how it affects our interactions with others. The project will be developed in three phases.<br><br>

In the first phase, LAN's first album and corresponding music videos will be written and created, and motion capture will be used to animate her 3D rendered likeness. In the second phase, her holographic persona will be created with which she will perform live in concerts and galleries. The third phase will lock in her performance and gallery spaces where her fans will be able to connect with her.<br><br>

This project is timely as it raises important questions about the human experience in a digital age. It is also an innovative way to bring together technology and entertainment to create a unique and immersive experience for the audience. Through LAN's story, the project aims to inspire resilience and hope in the face of adversity, while also exploring the relationship between humans and technology. </p>





<h2>What is the reason for this project?</h2>

<p>LAN is an allegory for the modern feelings of isolation and alienation many people feel today. LAN is meant to be an example of someone in the same situation as many of us. She is disconnected; lost and will never be able to be a real human, however she is trying. She is trying to be seen and heard even though it is futile. And this is an example for us to never give up and even though some things are impossible we can still try. It also draws attention to pathways we can take to create a more connected future through art and music.</p>
