<!-- <p>have you ever touched a pixel? Do you think you could love an imaginary friend like you love your best friend?
	Im not asking retorically. Im just wondering what it could be like to know you. <br> <br>
s
	Do you remember the last time you felt like no one could ever love you? Or when you felt so different from someone standing right in front of you that you felt like a different spiecis? Or when did it hit you that know one will ever see what's inside your head? When did you realize that no matter how hard you try you will always be alone?

	Sometimes the barriers between us seem so high that you build a bowl the you reside inside and lonliness slowly drips in; lonliness is something you can drown in.</p>


		<p> I want this wedsite to do too many things. Idealy the website would start off with a poem
			about lonliness that you click through and interact with like you would a twinery project. <br><br> -->


		<!-- <p1> To be honest this project doesn't feel great to me. it's missing personality. She needs something extra special. <br><br> 
		also it feels too much like a video game.</p1> -->
